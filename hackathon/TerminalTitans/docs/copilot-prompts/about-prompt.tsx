/*
PROMPT FOR GITHUB COPILOT:

This is a request to generate a complete, industrial-grade "About Us" page for "PROCTO".
The page should be a React component using Tailwind CSS, adhering to the existing modern, dark-mode theme.
The goal is to build trust, establish our mission, and introduce our team.

Please generate the following components in this specific order:

Main Layout Wrapper:

The component should assume it is rendered within the main layout, so it does not need to render the Navbar or Footer itself. It should just render the page content.

Hero Section (Mission-Driven):

A full-width section at the top of the page with large vertical padding.

A large, bold H1 title: "Our Mission: Ensuring Integrity in Every Exam"

A sub-headline paragraph (light, e.g., text-gray-300): "We believe that everyone deserves a fair and accessible education. PROCTO was built to uphold academic honesty and provide equal opportunities for students everywhere, no matter where they learn."

A high-quality, professional placeholder image on the right (in a 2-column layout with the text).

"Our Story" Section:

A two-column layout (text on left, image on right), with vertical padding.

Headline: "The Future of Fair Assessment"

Text: A 2-3 paragraph story about why PROCTO was founded. Explain the "problem" (e.g., "Remote learning created a challenge for maintaining academic integrity...") and how PROCTO is the "solution" ("...so we built a scalable, secure, and student-friendly platform...").

Image: A placeholder image.

"Our Values" Section:

A centered headline: "The Principles That Guide Us"

A responsive 3 or 4-column grid.

Each grid item should be a "value card" (dark background, e.g., bg-gray-800, rounded).

Each card contains:

An SVG Icon (from heroicons).

A Value Title ("Integrity," "Privacy," "Accessibility," "Innovation").

A short description (e.g., for "Privacy": "We are committed to protecting student data...").

"Meet the Team" Section:

A centered headline: "The Minds Behind PROCTO"

A responsive 4-column grid.

Each grid item is a "profile card" containing:

A circular placeholder for a headshot.

Name (e.g., "Jane Doe").

Title (e.g., "Founder & CEO").

A small icon-link for LinkedIn.

Include 4 placeholder team members.

"Join Our Mission" (Careers CTA) Section:

A final, centered Call-to-Action section, perhaps with a slightly different background to make it stand out.

Headline: "Help Us Shape the Future"

Text: "We're always looking for passionate people to join our team."

A primary button: "View Careers"
